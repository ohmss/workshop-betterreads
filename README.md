# üèÅ Start Hands-on

## 5. Create Astra DB Instance

> Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-AstraDB-Instance) create a database. *Right-Click the button* with *Open in a new TAB.*

<a href="https://astra.dev/2-16"><img src="img/create_astra_db_button.png?raw=true" /></a>

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Database Name**| `workshops`|
|**Keyspace Name**| `better_reads`|

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes:
- If you already have a DB, you may need to resume it using the [Resuming Guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/How-to-resume-a-database).
- If yout already have an active DB, simply add a keyspace `better_reads` using the `Add Keyspace` button on the bottom right hand corner of db dashboard page.

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-content)

## 6. Create Astra Token

> Leveraging [Token creation guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-Astra-Token) create a token. (`AstraCS:blablablabla`)

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Role**| `Database Administrator`|

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes:
- If you already have a token from previous session you can use it. A token is not related to a particular DB by default but to organization.

## 7. Start and setup Gitpod

- Start gitpod with the button below *(right-click open in new tab)*

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ohmss/workshop-betterreads)

- Wait for the environment to initialize until you are asked to provide your token:

```
‚úî Please paste the Database Admin Token here
```

- Enter your token `AstraCS;blahblahblah` and press enter. Wait for all the operations to complete.

```bash

```

## 8. Work with CqlSh

#### ‚úÖ 8a. Open new Terminal

It would be handy to have access to this CQLSH while doing the exercises and check the content of the database.

- Open a new terminal with the icon looking like a small table on top right hand corner of the Terminal Panel in gitpod (as shown below)

![new_terminal2](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/new-terminal1.png?raw=true)

... zooming in:  

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/new-terminal2.png?raw=true)

#### ‚úÖ 8b. Enter the interactive Cqlsh *(it is a script we have created for you)*

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/cqlsh
```

- It should look like

```
Connected to cndb at 127.0.0.1:9042.
[cqlsh 6.8.0 | Cassandra 4.0.0.6816 | CQL spec 3.4.5 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
token@cqlsh>
```

- List Keyspaces with 

```sql
describe keyspaces;
```

- Check that our keyspace `better_reads` is there

```
token@cqlsh> describe keyspaces;

system_virtual_schema  system_auth   data_endpoint_auth  system_traces
temporal_visibility    system_views  better_reads        ecommerce    
netflix                system        spring_petclinic    todos        
system_schema          datastax_sla  native_java         feeds_reader 

token@cqlsh> 
```

- List `better_reads` tables

```
use better_reads;
describe tables;
```

- Check that expected tables are there

```bash
token@cqlsh:better_reads> describe tables;

author_by_id  books_by_user  book_by_id  book_by_user_and_bookid
```

- Let this panel opened but for following command we will be back to the termimal
- 

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-content)

## 9. Load Data with DSBulk

- Check you have the dataset ready. In the `BASH` terminal **(‚ö†Ô∏è = NOT the cqlsh)**. You should see the cql file `book_by_id_0.csv`.

```
ls -l /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/
```

- Check how many rows. It should have more than 250k.

```
wc -l /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/book_by_id_0.csv
```

- Check that Datastax bulk loader is properly installed *(It has been installed for you at startup)*

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/dsbulk-1.8.0/bin/dsbulk --version
```

- Import the DataSet with the following command

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/dsbulk-1.8.0/bin/dsbulk load \
   -c csv \
   -k better_reads \
   -t book_by_id \
   -u token \
   -p ${ASTRA_DB_ADMIN_TOKEN} \
   -maxErrors -1 \
   -b /home/gitpod/.astra/scb_${ASTRA_DB_ID}_${ASTRA_DB_REGION}.zip \
   -url /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/book_by_id_0.csv
```

- The batch is running and should be able to see the throughput at ~3k records per second.

```

A cloud secure connect bundle was provided: ignoring all explicit contact points.
A cloud secure connect bundle was provided and selected operation performs writes: changing default consistency level to LOCAL_QUORUM.
Operation directory: /workspace/workshop-betterreads/logs/LOAD_20220214-132501-509314
 total | failed | rows/s | p50ms | p99ms | p999ms | batches
17,152 |      0 |  3,074 | 22.68 | 58.98 | 103.81 |    1.00
```

- The operation should take about 1 minute to complete. The file can have some errors like invalid title with special characters. IT IS NOT A PROBLEM the dataset is not perfect we will have some failed rows.

```
  total | failed | rows/s | p50ms | p99ms | p999ms | batches
250,000 |    183 |  3,684 | 21.44 | 56.10 |  66.32 |    1.00
Operation LOAD_20220214-185449-001328 completed with 183 errors in 1 minute and 7 seconds.
```

- In the same way - you can also now import `book_by_id_1.csv`.

- Count Records in the table `book_by_id`

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/dsbulk-1.8.0/bin/dsbulk count \
   -k better_reads \
   -t book_by_id \
   -u token \
   -p ${ASTRA_DB_ADMIN_TOKEN} \
   -b /home/gitpod/.astra/scb_${ASTRA_DB_ID}_${ASTRA_DB_REGION}.zip
```

- Expected output (about 500.000k), during the live speaker will have more because he imported way more files.

## 10. Use Application as anonymous

- It would be handy to know the URL of the application

```
gp url 8080
```

- Start the app

```
cd /workspace/workshop-betterreads/better-reads-webapp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Output

```

```

- Open a new terminal (yes a 3rd one again, 2 previous are busy, same icon) and enter the command.

```
gp preview $(gp url 8080)
```

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app1.png?raw=true)

- In the search item look for `Glimpses of ancient Sowams` you can search to whatever you want it will request open library ut during this workshop you only imported a subset of books, let us pick one you imported.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app2.png?raw=true)

- Select the first item, if you select the second you will hit the page book not found as this book is not in the DB.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app3.png?raw=true)

This is only what we can do at this point. To mark the book as read we will need to authenticate with `Google` or `Github`.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/gcp8.png?raw=true)

- Add the URL home page. It will the result of `gp url 8080` command on gitpod or *http://localhost:8080* if you work locally.

**The screenshots below show `Google` authentication when the app is running on `localhost`. Carefully adjust the URLs accordingly to the Gitpod URL when application is running on Gitpod.**

- Add the redirect *http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/google* if you work locally or the result of `echo $(gp url 8080)/login/oauth2/code/google` on gitpod.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/gcp9.png?raw=true)

- A new page will open with your `clientId` and `client Secret`. Make sure you copy them locallym you will need to setup your application with it.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/gcp10.png?raw=true)

```
You are now doomed we will now mine cryptos with your google account.

Just kidding ^_^
``` 

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/gcp11.png?raw=true)

- Open file `src/main/resources/application.yml` in your project

```
gp open /workspace/workshop-betterreads/better-reads-webapp/src/main/resources/application.yml
```

            client-id: change
            client-secret: change
```


### ‚úÖ 11b. Setup up Github

As each attendee has a different URL in gitpod, you will have to create your own github `OAuth Apps - Let's do this together.

- For github settings we will have to enter a callback URL. To know which one enter use the following command

```
clear
echo $(gp url 8080)/login/oauth2/code/github
```

- Login to your github account and go to `Organizations`

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps1.png?raw=true)

- There scroll down to locate the last item of the menu `Developer Settings` *(hopefully you have not as many organizations as me)*, There pick `OAuth Apps` (we are using OAuth)

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps2.png?raw=true)

- Click button `[New OAuth Apps]` on the page

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps3.png?raw=true)

| `Application name`| The application name shown to user |
| `Homepage URL`| Can be anything, just the app (gp url 8080) |
| `Authorization Callback URL`| Call back url the one listed above `${homepage}/login/oauth2/code/github` |

- Click `[Register Application]`

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps4.png?raw=true)

- The application is created. You got your clientId. You will have to generate a clientSecret now. Once you get both save them on a text file in your machine we will need them later

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps5.png?raw=true)

- When everything is set you can upload am image for your application and save the change with `[Update Application]`.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps6.png?raw=true)
 
- Open `application.yml`

- Open file `src/main/resources/application.yml` in your project
